Lawyer Plugin is the first Wordpress plugin made EXCLUSIVELY for lawyers. We have thousands of legal resources in a human-verified database.

== Installation ==

1. In your WordPress admin, go to `Dashboard > Plugins > Add New.`
1. Search for Lawyer Plugin and click the install link.
1. Install the plugin and activate.

Authenticate using your LawyerPlugin.com credentials so you can easily create and retrieve your firm's profile right from your WordPress dashboard.

Once you have authorized your plugin, fill in your law firm's address, select up to 3 practice areas, and Lawyer Plugin will block competing firms when your site gets the latest legal resources.

Your site will also get inbound traffic from other verified listings. The practice areas you select will also determine which resources your website receives.

Add a new page, or edit an existing one, and insert `[resources]` in the content where you wish them to be shown.

== Frequently asked questions ==

= What resources will display on my website? =

National general law resources, state specific resources, and practice-area-specific resources will display on your website. When you setup your profile after installing the plugin, it will decide what needs to be displayed.

= Will resources for other practice areas display on my site? =

Only resources related to your practice areas will display. For example, a bankruptcy law firm will not have personal injury resources, and vice versa.

= Where is the information stored? =

Only resources to be displayed on your website will be imported. All other resources are stored on Lawyer Plugin’s central server.

= How are resources updated? =

Your website will sync with the Lawyer Plugin server to keep resources up-to-date and add new ones. This is done automatically every 24 hours without using excessive server resources.

= Can non-lawyers use Lawyer Plugin? =

Lawyer Plugin was built for attorneys but can be used by non-lawyers. However, only attorneys can be included in the peer-to-peer directory.
